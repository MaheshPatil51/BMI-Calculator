# BMI-Calculator
BMI Calculator is a web-based application that calculates Body Mass Index using user-provided height and weight. It helps users quickly determine their weight category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight, or Obese) based on standard BMI ranges. This project is built to practice basic web development concepts and logical implementation.
